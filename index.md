# About Rachael Craig

I’m interested in the specific actions, abstractions and solutions required of leaders and systems to create progress for human beings.

Much of my life’s work is focused on progress in the form of medical science commercialization, but the same concepts apply equally well to many other areas of leadership and progress.

This website is a place for me to collect thinking and perspectives on the above that don’t fit in other spaces in my life, and reflects my personal views.

Why is progress so hard?

In science commercialization, the challenge results from the complexity of working at the intersection of science and business. To bring a single piece of new technology to market, many different human personalities, stakeholding positions and talent profiles need to decision, adjust and align in order to bring a single piece of new technology to market. To experience progress, we need to be able to work practically within this complexity to create sufficient conditions for commercialization success. These are substantial!

In 2016, I co-founded MotionHall, a software company that works to reduce barriers to science commercialization by providing biopharma’s executives with transparency into the markets for pharmaceutical IP. This is similar to what Bloomberg did for financial markets, and CoStar for commercial real estate.

As MotionHall’s CEO, I work with biopharmaceutical executives globally with a focus on successful IP transactions strategy, which is largely about navigating the complexity mentioned above.
