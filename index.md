# About Rachael Craig

Science is hard to commercialize. Even if we could invest more money into basic research and new companies, we wouldn’t see the type of progress we want. Why is that?

At the heart of this problem is the complexity of working at the intersection of science and business, and all of the different human personalities, stakeholding positions and talent profiles that need to decision, adjust and align in order to bring a single piece of new technology to market. To experience progress, we need to be able to understand the hidden forces that dictate commercialization success and how to adjust them.

In 2016, I co-founded MotionHall, a technology startup that works to reduce barriers to science commercialization by providing biopharma’s executives with transparency into the markets for pharmaceutical IP. This is similar to what Bloomberg did for financial markets, and CoStar for commercial real estate. 

As MotionHall’s CEO, I work with biopharmaceutical executives globally with a focus on successful IP transactions strategy, which is largely about navigating the complexity mentioned above.

## MotionHall

I founded MotionHall to help people bring new medical science to patients. Our approach combines data-rich workflows with deep domain expertise to create flexible solutions for biopharma’s business and corporate development leaders. 
 
Our unique analytical and knowledge capabilities are made possible by years of combined research and development with Artificial Intelligence scientists, data scientists, and accomplished biotech and pharmaceutical executives, investment bankers and venture capitalists.
